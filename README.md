# IoT - Enabled Oximeter

## Introduction
With the rapid evolution of healthcare technology start-ups, IoT is fundamentally reshaping the healthcare industry. However, monitoring the health status of patients at home poses a significant challenge due to busy schedules and daily life commitments, particularly for elderly patients who require periodic monitoring.

## Proposal
To address this challenge, we propose an innovative system that automates patient health tracking with ease. Our device introduces a smart patient health tracking system utilizing Web Server technology. This system enables the monitoring of essential health parameters such as Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen level, and body temperature in real-time.

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to develop an IoT-based Patient Health Monitoring System. Key components of the system include:
- **MAX30100/102 Pulse Oximeter Sensor**: Measures Heart Rate/Pulse (BPM) and Blood Oxygen Level (SpO2).
- **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor**: Measures the temperature of the body.
- **DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor**: Monitors room temperature and humidity to ensure patient comfort.

## Implementation
By leveraging these sensors, our system provides comprehensive health tracking for patients. Join us in revolutionizing healthcare by making patient monitoring more accessible and efficient.
